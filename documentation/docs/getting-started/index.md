# Getting Started

Welcome to ORMDB! This section will help you get up and running quickly.

## Overview

ORMDB is an ORM-first relational database. Instead of writing SQL queries, you define your data model as entities and relations, then query them using a typed, graph-oriented protocol.

## What You'll Learn

2. **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)** - Build a simple app in 5 minutes
3. **[Your First App](first-app.md)** - A complete tutorial building a blog application

## Prerequisites

- **Rust**: If using the Rust client, you need Rust 1.70+
- **Node.js**: If using the TypeScript client, you need Node.js 18+
- **Python**: If using the Python client, you need Python 3.9+
- **Docker**: Optional, for running the server easily
